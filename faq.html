                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <h2 id='leaveblank'></h2>
                <p><b>Q: Do you charge an entrance fee to visit?</b><br><br> <b>A:</b> Short answer: yes. Guests pay for entry (which includes some farm activities) when scheduling a visit. This is covered in more detail on the '<a href='visits.html'>Farm Visits</a>' page.</p>
                <p><b>Q: Do you allow dogs on the farm?</b><br><br> <b>A:</b> We welcome dogs that behave well around farm animals, other dogs, and individuals of all ages, and remain 100% on a leash for the duration of their visit. We also ask that dogs bring owners that clean up after them.</p>
                <p><b>Q: Is there anything that we are required to bring for our visit?</b><br><br> <b>A:</b> We would recommend weather appropriate attire and footwear; and don't forget your camera!  </p>
                <p><b>Q: Do you accept cards for payment?</b><br><br> <b>A:</b> Yes. We accept all Visa and Mastercard credit/debit cards.</p>
                <p><b>Q: Do you host birthdays?</b><br><br> <b>A:</b>It is a joy for us to share our farm with you on your special day. However, each guest will still have to schedule their <a href='visits.html'>Farm Visit</a>, and we will not be supplying tables or organization. </p>
                <p><b>Q: Do you host field trips?</b><br><br> <b>A:</b> Group size can not exceed the scheduling limit for each 60 minute window, and we will not be organizing field trip rotations as we have in the past.</p>
