            <h2><b>Birthday Parties</b></h2>
            <p>Birthdays are such a fun time and we thoroughly enjoy being a part of the celebration here 
                at Creek House Farm. If you choose to have a birthday party here, 
                you have the opportunity to participate in farm activities
                along with other farm guests. Please remember that your admission allows for a 90 minute farm visit (including your birthday celebration).
                <br><br>

                We do offer you the option of having a special place set-aside for your group, with our large 
                picnic table and benches, as a place for your group to celebrate your birthday.  You will need to supply/bring along your own decorations and paper products for your 
                party, as well as cleaning up the area and disposing of your own trash, when you are 
                finished. As we are a family farm, which attracts many young children, we ask that you do 
                not include anything frightening or scary in your decorations. Typical children themes are 
                acceptable, along with happy pumpkins, or autumn/harvest/farm themes. You are welcome to bring 
                birthday refreshments for your party, but we do not allow alcohol on our farm.<br><br> There is no venue fee 
                for having a birthday at our farm. An <u><a href='visits.html' >admission package</a></u> must be purchased for each guest when you 
                make your reservation. Please contact the farm prior to making your online reservation to confirm that our 
                birthday area is available at the time you desire.
