            <h2><u>Why Do We Farm Organic?</u></h2>
            <p>There are many reasons for organic farming today. Organic foods are generally healthier, with improved taste, and organic farming practices are generally better 
                for the environment. Our reasons are quite simple. The food we grow here on our farm is also the food we place on the table for our family. Our farm is where we live, work,
                 and play. The soils on our 
                farm have been entrusted to our care, and we want to be the very best stewards we can be; for the sake of our family, the guests that visit our farm, and those who 
                will dwell here in the future.
                <br>Important to note: we have not chosen to be "certified organic" officially by the government; but we follow the basic principles of organic farming as well as 
                sustainable agriculture, 
                and we continue to learn more and improve our practices every year.</p></div></div>

                <h2>Why Do We Grow Heirloom?</h2>
                <p>As with organic, there are many folks moving toward heirloom produce as well. The reasons are many and well worth researching. 
                    We choose heirloom because we prefer non-GMO foods, we like the variety of tastes, textures and appearances available with heirloom vegetables, and the unique 
                    histories of some heirloom plants are very interesting! <br>Note: In recent years we have added a few hybrid varieties to our crop as well, to offer some additional, unique characteristics to choose from. These are non-GMO varieties.<br><br>For more information on varieties that we have grown on our farm, check out the "Pumpkins" page!</p>
