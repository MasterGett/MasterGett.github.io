            <h2><b>Planning to Visit?</b></h2>
            <p>We love to welcome guests to the farm in October! Just so you know...we are a small family farm, and our farm doesn't offer the "big" attractions available at 
                larger farms. (No roller coasters or catapults here...) Our farm is very well suited to younger children, so if your family/group is heavily weighted to older kids....they 
                may be disappointed if they are seeking a really-big-farm! <br><br>It has been our experience that older kiddos that come along with their families and younger siblings are 
                happy if they're used to doing things that appeal to all ages. It just depends on the kids, and what they are accustomed to or expecting.  You know your group best. 

                It is truly our hope and our heart that folks are blessed by coming here and sharing our farm.</p></div></div>

                <h2 style="text-align:justify">How It Works</h2>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Visits will be by appointment ONLY. 
                    Admission is through an online ticketing system. The cost of admission is $7.50 per person (Infants under 24 months do not need to purchase a ticket, their admission is free). 
                    <br><div style='text-align:justify; width:90%;'>Each Individual Admission includes:
                        <br><b>a.</b> 60 minute farm visit (+15 for arrival/+15 for departure)<br>
                        <b>b.</b> Farm Ride<br>
                                hay ride* -all day on weekends & evenings after 4pm 
                                        <br>-OR-<br>
                                pumpkin barrel ride (for children only)* -weekdays before 4pm<br>
                                    <b>c.</b> Opportunity to visit and feed farm animals<br>
                                    <b>d.</b> Three (3) water balloons (per paying guest) for pumpkin slingshot<br>
                                    <b>e.</b> Pumpkin trail adventure and puzzle<br>
                                    <b>f.</b> Opportunities for photos<br>
                                    <b>g.</b> A wagon, assigned to you at check in, to be utilized during your visit<br>
                                    <b>h.</b> Opportunity to select a pumpkin to take home (NOTE: Pumpkins are purchased
                             separately. They are NOT included with admission. You do not have to buy a pumpkin to
                            visit the farm, but if you want to take one home, you must purchase it before you leave.)<br>*these can change without notice<br></div><br><br>
                            The booking system is set up to allow 15 people to book every 20 minutes 
                            on the farm. This staggers arrival and departure times at the farm stand, but we anticipate your ‚Äúon farm‚Äù visit will be around an hour or so. If you are trying to book a large 
                            group together, we still cannot exceed the on-farm capacity that we have established, but we CAN make your arrival and departure time concurrent instead of staggered. Let us know 
                            what you‚Äôre trying to do, and we‚Äôll see how we can make it work on our end.<br><br> 
                            Additionally, we will not be hosting any parties or field trips. (You are welcome to attend as a group, by online 
                            booking together, but we will not be providing picnic tables for parties, nor field trip organization as we have in prior years.)

                            <br><br>
                    If you desire to reserve the entire farm for your visit, we can arrange that, by booking all the appointments for the time frame you prefer, plus the appointments prior to your visit, 
                    so the farm is entirely empty except for your group (which still cannot exceed the preset capacity). (At $7.50 per booking slot, that could be expensive, but it is possible.)<br><br>
                    Gather together with your family or group of close friends, and book your visit times together! Then you're sharing the farm with folks you know!<br><br>
                    What we ask of our guests‚Ä¶. PLEASE BE CONSIDERATE OF OTHERS. Crowd sizes will be much smaller than previous years. If everyone is kind, and 
                            considerate, understanding, respecting, and protecting of others with their attitudes, words and behaviors‚Ä¶ the pumpkin patch will continue to be a pleasant place for everyone‚Ä¶ a 
                            chance to make special memories with those close to us.<br><br>
                    Our family will be working very hard to run the farm. We will not have the time, nor do we desire to monitor/police behaviors. If you feel you cannot abide by expectations 
                    of kind and considerate behavior (regardless of your opinions on either side of difficult issues), or if you feel the need to make a profound social statement in public 
                    settings, we very humbly invite you to consider visiting a different farm, or perhaps selecting pumpkins at one of the many grocery stores in the area.<br><br>Let us all work together to create a pleasant atmosphere for a fun and enjoyable pumpkin season!<br><br>
                    <div style='text-align: center;'>Looking forward to seeing you at the farm in October!<br>
