            <h2><u>Planning A Visit?</u></h2>
            <p>We love to welcome groups to the farm in October! We offer a few different options for groups visiting the pumpkin patch, and we invite you to consider each, and 
                decide which one best suits the needs of your group.<br><br> Just so you know...we are a small family farm, and our farm doesn't offer the "big" attractions available at 
                larger farms. (No roller coasters or catapults here...) Our farm is very well suited to younger children, so if your group is heavily weighted to older kids....they 
                may be disappointed if they are seeking a really-big-farm! <br><br>It has been our experience that older kiddos that come along with their families and younger siblings are 
                happy if they're used to doing things that appeal to all ages. It just depends on the kids, and what they are accustomed to or expecting.  You know your group best. 

                It is truly our hope and our heart that folks are blessed by coming here and sharing our farm.</p></div></div>
